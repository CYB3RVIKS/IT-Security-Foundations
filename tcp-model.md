# Understanding the TCP/IP Model

The **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)** model is the foundation of modern computer networking. It defines how data is transmitted between devices over the internet and local networks.

## TCP/IP Model Overview

| Layer | Common Protocols / Technologies |
|--------|---------------------------------|
| **Application Layer** | Telnet, FTP, TFTP, HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, IMAP |
| **Transport Layer** | TCP, UDP |
| **Internet Layer** | Internet Protocol (IP), ICMP |
| **Local Network Layer** | Ethernet, Wi-Fi |
| **Physical Layer** | Wi-Fi Radios, NICs, Copper Cables, Fibre Optic Cables |

## 1. Application Layer

The **Application Layer** includes protocols that enable communication between application processes. It is responsible for creating and interpreting data exchanged between applications.

### Responsibilities
- Defines message formats and communication rules for applications.
- Allows users to access network services.

### Common Protocols
- **HTTP/HTTPS** – Browsing web pages
- **FTP/TFTP** – Transferring files
- **SMTP** – Sending emails
- **POP3/IMAP** – Receiving emails
- **Telnet** – Remote terminal access

> **Note:** Network devices such as **routers** and **switches** do not process information at this layer.

## 2. Transport Layer

The **Transport Layer** provides **end-to-end communication** between applications running on different hosts. It ensures that data reaches the correct service on the destination device.

### Responsibilities
- Process-to-process (service-to-service) communication
- Uses **port numbers** to identify applications
- Runs primarily on the communicating hosts

### Protocols
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**

---

## 3. Internet Layer

The **Internet Layer** is responsible for delivering data between hosts across different networks.

### Responsibilities
- Uses **IP addresses** to identify hosts
- Routers forward packets between networks

### Protocols
- **Internet Protocol (IP)**
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**

---

## 4. Local Network Layer

The **Local Network Layer** (also known as the Network Access Layer) handles communication within the same local network.

### Responsibilities
- Provides **hop-to-hop** delivery
- Uses **MAC addresses** to identify network interfaces
- Switches operate primarily at this layer

### Technologies
- Ethernet
- Wi-Fi

---

## 5. Physical Layer

The **Physical Layer** is responsible for transmitting and receiving raw signals over the physical transmission medium.

### Examples
- Copper UTP cables
- Fibre optic cables
- Wi-Fi radios and antennas
- Network Interface Cards (NICs)

## Key Takeaways

- The **Application Layer** provides services to users and applications.
- The **Transport Layer** ensures data reaches the correct application using **TCP** or **UDP**.
- The **Internet Layer** routes packets using **IP addresses**.
- The **Local Network Layer** delivers frames within a local network using **MAC addresses**.
- The **Physical Layer** transmits data as electrical, optical, or wireless signals.
